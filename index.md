## Turbopump Controller

So to get the whole fusor working, I need to generate a vacuum, and to generate a vauum I need some pumps. In particular I need a turbopump and a backing pump. I have both, but only the backing pump is working. The turbopump needs a controller, and those are expensive so I've decided to build my own!

### The Program
I wanted to use this project as an excuse to pick up another new language, [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)), I've been curious about it for awhile largely because of it's safety features. Handily a bunch of people have been doing a bunch of work to get it running on the RP 2040, which powers the Raspberry Pi Pico that I have on the PCB.

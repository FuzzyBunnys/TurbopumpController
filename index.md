## Turbopump Controller

So to get the whole fusor working, I need to generate a vacuum, and to generate a vauum I need some pumps. In particular I need a turbopump and a backing pump. I have both, but only the backing pump is working. The turbopump needs a controller, and those are expensive so I've decided to build my own!

### The Program
